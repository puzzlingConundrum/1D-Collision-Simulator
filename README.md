# 1D-Collision-Simulator
A 1D Block Collision Simulator.

To begin, right-click to open a dialog menu for a new block creation.
Either press the default block to create block with a mass of 5 and a velocity of 1 or press custom to define your own "custom block"
After that, move your mouse to the desired location and left-click to initialize your block into the world!

There is a pause/play button on the top-right corner to pause/resume the animation. Left-clicking on a block will disply the block's information (mass and speed) above the block.
And there you have it--The 1D Collision Simulator!
